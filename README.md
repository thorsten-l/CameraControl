# CameraControl for Canon digital cameras with Bluetooth or WiFi conectivity

WiFi conectivity ist prepared but not implemented yet.

Now im implementing WiFi Canon Connect API. (all newer Canon cameras like Rxxx or M6m2)

The last thing I want to do is to implement the Picture Transfer Protocol via IP. (PTP/IP)
