# CameraControl for Canon digital cameras with Bluetooth or WiFi conectivity

- Bluetooth is fully functional except for Wide and Tele Buttons. I've no Camera to check it.

- WiFi conectivity ist prepared but not implemented yet.

# Canon Camera Connect API
Now i am implementing WiFi Canon Connect API. (all newer Canon cameras like Rxxx or M6m2)

You need the *CCAPI Activation Tool* from the [Canon Developers Program](https://developers.canon-europe.com/s/camera) to enable the Camera Connect API in your Camera. It it a good documented REST API to all settings, actions and events. In my opinion Canon should eneble the CCAPI by default. You find the additional CCAPI menu entry in the WiFi settings.

The last thing I want to do is to implement the Picture Transfer Protocol via IP. (PTP/IP)
(for all legacy WiFi cameras e.g. 5Dm4)
